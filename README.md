<h2>DatingApp</h2>
<p>This is a C#/.NET web application with an Angular 11 front end that is built as part of a course on Udemy by Neil Cummings. The app simulates a dating app such as Match, eHarmony, etc. on a rudimentary scale. My goal for this course, since I do work with C# on a daily basis implementing server side rendering logic for PDF report generation, is to develop the skills necessary to stand up a full stack .NET application.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Angular 11
    <li>JavaScript
    <li>TypeScript
    <li>.NET Core
